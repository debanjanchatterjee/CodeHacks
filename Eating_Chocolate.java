/*
Eating chocolate problem: A and B starts eating a chocolate bar of size x. The participants can eat ith amount of the chocolate where i is the turn parameter, indicating ith bite.
A starts eating from the left while B starts eating from the right. Each participant takes turn to take a bite of ith size. A takes the first bite.
If the size of remaining chocolate bar is less than the required amount to be eaten by A or B in that turn, then they lose. The last participant to take a full bite wins.
The code displays the winner.
